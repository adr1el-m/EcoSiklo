<section class="About" id="about">
    <h1 class="heading">ABOUT</h1>
    <h2 class="aboutDescription">
        EcoSiklo is a platform dedicated to fostering a sustainable future by bridging the gap between recyclers, consumers, and businesses in a transparent and accessible recycling ecosystem. We empower recyclers to create detailed profiles, showcasing their services, locations, and the types of materials they handle, making it easier for consumers and businesses to find and support their efforts. This platform enables recyclers to list the types of recyclable materials they accept and the products they offer, promoting a more accessible and efficient recycling process.
        <br>        
        <br>
        Consumers can explore profiles of various recyclers, giving them the option to donate recyclable materials or purchase products made from recycled materials, thereby supporting the recycling ecosystem. Businesses are encouraged to engage by selling their scrap materials to recyclers and purchasing recycled products, contributing to a circular economy where waste is minimized, and resources are continuously repurposed. EcoSiklo not only simplifies the recycling process but also strengthens the connections between all stakeholders, driving collective action toward a greener and more sustainable future.
