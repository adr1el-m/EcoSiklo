            Companies can participate in the platform by selling their
            scrap materials to recyclers, ensuring that these materials are
            properly recycled and reused. Moreover, businesses can
            purchase recycled products, which can be showcased as part of
            their commitment to sustainability. By engaging in this
            closed-loop system, businesses contribute to a circular
            economy, where waste is minimized, and resources are
            continually repurposed.
